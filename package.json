The data comes from the New York Times (see [here for more information](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-county-data-us.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) and [here for the GitHub data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)). The idea for the chart comes from [this similar one from Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-confirmed-cases-since-100th-case).",
