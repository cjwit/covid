      This chart tracks cases of COVID-19 across the USA from the date when each state first had at least 100 reported
      cases. The data comes from the New York Times (see <a
        href='https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-county-data-us.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage'>here
        for more information</a> and <a href='https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data'>here for the GitHub data</a>).
      The
      idea for the chart comes from <a
        href='https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-confirmed-cases-since-100th-case'>this similar one from Our World
        in Data</a>.
    </p>

      I wouldn't depend on this for much, it's mostly a chance for me to see a graph that I wish were easier to find
      while
      checking to see if I remember how to use D3.js.
